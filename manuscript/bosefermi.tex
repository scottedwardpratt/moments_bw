\section{Bose and Fermi Statistics}\label{sec:theorybosefermi}

Including Bose and Fermi statistics in calculating the partition functions is straight-forward, and was shown in \cite{}. The method is related to that used for calculating the effects of multi-boson interference for pion interferometry. In a fixed volume the partition function can be first treated as the usual procedure of accounting for $n$ identical particles being in different single-particle states. This includes the $1/n!$ term to account for the fact that particles are indistinguishable, i.e. the Gibbs paradox. If $m_\ell$ indestinguishable particles are in the same single-particle state $\ell$, one must correct the weight by a factor of $m_\ell!$ for each level, which can also be thought of as the analog of the symmetrized relative wave function with all the momenta being equal. For fermions, the weight becomes $(-1)^{\ell-1}m_\ell$. As demonstrated in \cite{}, the recurrence relation to the partition function then becomes
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:Zbf}
Z_{A}(Q,B,S)&=\frac{1}{A}\sum_h \sum_n Z_{A-n}(Q-nq_h,B-nb_h,Q-nq_h)z_{h,n}(\pm 1)^{n-1},
\end{eqnarray}
where $z_{h,n}$ is the partition function for $n$ particles in any level, 
\begin{eqnarray}
z_{h,n}&=\sum_\ell e^{-n\beta(\epsilon_\ell-\mu_iq_i)}.
\end{eqnarray}
The $\pm 1$ refers to bosons or fermions. For hadron gases in the high temperature environments of relativistic heavy ion collisions, only pions have a non-negligible correction from quantum degeneracy. The correction for order $n$ for any level $\ell$ is of the order $e^{-\beta(\epsilon_\ell-\mu_iq_i)}$ lower than the previous term. This factor is largest for zero momentum, and for pions becomes $e^{-\beta(m-\mu)}$. The chemical potential is $\mu_Q q_i$ if the pions are chemically equilibrated, but if the system is not chemically equilibrated $\mu$ is adjusted to fit the average pion density. For the zero-momentum level at a temperature of 150 MeV, the factor is $e^{-m/T}\approx 0.4$, and as the system cools probably falls slightly \cite{gong}. For a more characteristic thermal momentum the factor is $\approx 0.1$. For heavier particles the factor is always small. For example, for a zero-temperature $\rho$ meson the factor is a fraction of a percent.

Given that symmetrization is only being applied to pions, which are bosons, one can incorporate these corrections into the Monte Carlo procedure outlined in Sec. \ref{sec:theoryMC}. For fermions this might be problematic because of the negative weights coming from the $(-1)^(n-1)$ factors in Eq (\ref{eq:Zbf}). Here, the algorithm is adjusted by treating each value of $n$ as being a different species, with charges $nq_h$ and with the partition function calculated with a reduced temperature $T\rightarrow T/n$. If one picks such a species in step 3 of the algorithm, $n$ pions are generated, all with the same momentum. For a finite system, the pions would have a small relative momentum or order the inverse system size.

It is well known that bosonic effects can broaden multiplicity distributions \cite{negativebinomial}, making them super-Poissonian. One of the goals of this study is to discern how bosonic statistics alter the kurtosis or skewness.
