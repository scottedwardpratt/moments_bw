\section{Blast Wave Model with a Full Hadron Gas and Comparison to STAR Results}\label{sec:blast}

The calculations of the previous section were based on a simple picture, where each sub-volume emitted particles whose probability of being observed was uniform, denoted by $\alpha$. In practice, this probability depends on where the sub-volume is located within the overall reaction volume. A sub-volume in the region with spatial rapidity, $|\eta_s|>1$, emits particles that are only rarely detected in by detectors that specialize in mid-rapidity measurements. Even for a sub-volume centered at mid-rapidity, thermal motion can spread some of its emission to rapidities outside the acceptance. This is especially true when the experiments narrow their acceptance. For example, STAR's acceptance nominally covers $\pm 1$ units of pseudo-rapidity, but the acceptance for identified particles is confined to $\pm 0.9$ units. For real rapidity, the effective acceptance is narrowed further, due to the fact that the true rapidity $y$ is less than the pseudo-rapidity $\eta$. This difference magnifies for massive, or slower particles. In fact, STAR analyses of identified particles often make cuts and only consider particles with true rapidities $-0.5<y<0.5$. Of course, even for particles within the rapidity acceptance, the particles must exceed some minimum transverse momentum and the efficiency for being detected is imperfect. For particles identified only by charge, the efficiencies are typically $\gtrsim 80\%$, and for identified particles the efficiency falls by another few tens of percent.

Collective flow plays a critical role. First, longitudinal flow is what allows the measurement of rapidity to correlate to a measurement in coordinate-space rapidity. In the Bjorken model of boost invariant flow, the mapping is simple in that a fluid element with spatial rapidity $\eta_s$ moves with a rapidity $\eta_s$, and particles emitted from a sub-volume with rapidity $\eta_s$ have rapidities $y\approx\eta_s$. The mapping is smeared by the thermal motion. Collective radial flow and cooling combine to better align $\eta_s$ and $y$. The thermal spread for pions is $\approx 0.6$ units of rapidity, while that for protons is $\approx 0.25$.

The size of the sub-volume clearly drives the result. If the sub-volume is small, there is an enhanced probability that a charge and its balancing charge will both be identified and cancel one another. If the sub-volume extends over a large rapidity range, the effects of charge balance are minimized. The extent of the sub-volume in the transverse direction is less important. For sub-volumes at the edge of the fireball, which have more collective velocity, there is a modest increase of having balancing charges both pushed into the acceptance, and avoid the low $p_t$ cutoff, but that sensitivity is modest compared to the extent of the sub-volume in spatial rapidity. The transverse size also plays a role, as illustrated in the previous session, in that the canonical suppression is important for smaller overall volumes. 

The intent of this study is to overlay canonical sub-volumes onto a blast-wave model of collective flow and to filter the calculations with the STAR acceptance and efficiency. This should be sufficiently realistic to make meaningful comparisons to STAR data. The three main parameters for the blast-wave model typically describe the radial flow $u_\perp$, the kinetic freeze-out temperature, $T_k$, and the temperature of chemical freeze-out, $T_c$. The chemical freeze-out temperature, $T_c$, is chosen to fit relative particle yields, while $T_k$ and $U_\perp$ are determined by simultaneously fitting the spectra of species with varying mass, typically $\pi,K,p$. A variety of parameterizations exist, such as having the velocity increase linearly from the origin, or the transverse rapidity, or having a sharp cutoff in radius vs. assuming a Gaussian profile. Depending on the choice, the value of $T_k$ and $u_\perp$ vary, but are typically in the neighborhood of $T_k\approx 100$ MeV and $u_\perp\approx 0.6$. For increasing multiplicities, the reaction volumes can expand and cool further, which leads to modestly increased values of $u_\perp$ and modestly decreased values of $T_k$ for either more central or for more energetic collisions. For this study the chemical freeze-out temperatures were taken from \cite{}, which extracted $T_c$ for a variety of beam energies. Over 300 hadron species were included in the analysis. The flow and collective velocities were .....

Two additional parameters were added to the blast wave model. The first is the size of the sub-volume, $\Omega_c$, which was set to either 100, 200 or 500 fm$^3$, with 200 fm$^3$ being the default. This volume was used to generate the particles at $T_c$. The second additional parameter describes the size of a sub-volume in spatial rapidity at the time of final emission. Those particles created from a given sub-volume were assumed to spread out and be emitted from some region with a Gaussian spread in spatial rapidity, 
\begin{eqnarray}
S(\eta_s)&\propto&\exp\left\{-\frac{(\eta_s-\eta_0)^2}{2\sigma_\eta^2}\right\}.
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\eta_0$ is a uniformly distributed random value, with the uniformity being motivated by the assumption of boost invariance. The parameter $\sigma_\eta$ describes how far particles created from the same sub-volume may have separated by the time of emission. For increasingly larger values of $\sigma_eta$, the chance that any two observed particles are correlated decreases.  One goal of this section is to evaluate the sensitivity of fluctuations to $\Omega_c$ and $\sigma_\eta$. For this specific blast-wave model, each sub-volume was assigned a radial transverse velocity according to a Gaussian,
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dN}{d^2u_\perp}&\approx&e^{-(u_x^2+u_y^2)/2u_\perp^2}.
\end{eqnarray}

The calculations of this section are filtered through a simplified model of the STAR detector's acceptance and efficiency. For unidentified particles, pseudo-rapidities are required to be less than 1.0 and transverse momenta are constrained to being above 150 MeV/$c$. An efficiency of 0.8 is applied. For identified particles, additional cuts are added. Rapidities are required to be less than 0.9 and transverse momenta are cut off above 1.5 GeV/$c$. The efficiency is lowered to 0.6. In order to compare results to measurement from STAR the baryon densities and chemical freeze-out temperatures were mapped to beam energy according to the analysis of \cite{....}, which extracted chemical freeze-out temperatures and chemical potentials by considering ratios of particle yields. The parameter, $u_\perp$, which controls the transverse radial flow was chosen along with the kinetic breakup temperature, $T_k$, to simultaneously fit the mean transverse momenta of both the protons and pions. Decays were simulated, and the products of weak decays (aside from pions or charged kaons) were included in the analysis. Undoubtedly, a more realistic model of the acceptance might change the ratios, but given that these are ratios, and that the overall efficiency and acceptances are not wildly off, a more rigorous model of the acceptance is unlikely to change the result by more than a few percent.

Figure \ref{fig:} illustrates how the sensitivity of results to the size of the sub-volume.
